<h2> WHAT IS IT? </h2>
Created a port scanner script using Python.

Created a Python Port Scanner script. Once the script has been executed, it will request the target IP address. It will automatically begin detecting open ports, for range in 1-1000 ports using TCP. 

It will automatically create a port_logs.txt file on the local machine and writes all open ports found on the target host machine to the file created.
